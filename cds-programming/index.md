This is the website for the Center for Data Science's Python programming courses for data scientists. 
At the moment there are four courses being taught during the Fall/Spring semesters.

* [DS-GA 1007 Programming for Data Science](/programming)
* [DS-GA 3001 Advanced Python for Data Science](/advanced)

The goal of these courses is to teach data scienctists how to use computers more
effectively to make their research easier. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming that is necessary for conducting research. In
other words, the purpose of these courses is to teach you how to drive the car,
not prepare you to be a mechanic.

These course actively integrate
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org).

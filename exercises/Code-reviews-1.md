1. Work in groups of three using the repositories you created in Assignment 3.
2. Conduct three code reviews of the nbody_opt.py code. Two team members will act as reviewers and the third the reviewee.
3. Using the Issues tracker on GitHub, each team member is to open at least two issues against the other team member's repositories (four total).
4. Use the checklist as a guide as to what issues to open. Issues can cover the same topic, provided they apply to different code. i.e. each code review
   must establish four distinct issues.
5. Each team member should then address the four issues and commit the changes, one commit per issue, to their repository.

*Note: if you are unable to form a group of three, join an existing group to make four members. Each team member will need to open four issues in such a way
that each team member's repository still receives four issues in total.*

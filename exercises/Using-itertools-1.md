title: Using Itertools 1
---
Using the `nbody_opt.py` you wrote for *Assignment 3*, examine the code in light of your understanding of the `itertools` module.
Can you simplify the way you're doing anything using `itertools` methods? Are there any opportunities for improving the performance
of you code further using `itertools`? 

Place the modified code in a file called `nbody_iter.py` and commit it to the same repository.

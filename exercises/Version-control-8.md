title: Version Control 8
---

This is a follow up question to
[Version Control 7](/exercises/Version-control-7).

Both team members have been working late and sit down to edit `predict_richness.sh`. 
They both open the file in an editor. One reaches for a cup of coffee, and knocks
it over onto their computer! At the same time, a cat jumps on the keyboard of the other
team member's computer. In all of the excitement they both somehow delete the contents of 
the file and save it (go ahead, open it, delete the contents, press save). Thankfully the
team has been using using version control! The team members take a deep breath and revert
the changes using `git checkout`. Then they reflect on how using version control makes you 
just like Superman in Superman 1 because it's like time just went backwards.

title: Version Control 8
---

This is a follow up question to
[Version Control 7](/exercises/Version-control-7).

One team member has been working late and sits down to edit `predict_richness.sh`. 
They open the file in an editor, reach for a cup of coffee, knock it over onto their
computer and in all of the excitement somehow delete the contents of the file
and save it (go ahead, open it, delete the contents, press save). Thankfully the
team has been using using version control! The team member takes a deep breath, dries
off their computer, revert the changes using `git checkout`, and reflects on how 
using version control makes you just like Superman in Superman 1 because it's like 
time just went backwards.

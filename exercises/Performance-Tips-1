title: Performance Tips 1

An astrophysicist colleague was recently complaining about how long it was taking to run an N-body simulation. 
"It's really just a simple calculation, and I'm only simulating four planets, but it takes nearly a minute and
a half to run one simulation. I really need it done in under 30 seconds." You kindly offer to take a look at
code to see if it is possible to speed it up. Your colleague provides you with a 
[link to the source]({{ site.github.url }}/code/body.py).

*All assigments beginning with Assignment 3 are to be submitted via GitHub. Create
a new repository for each assignment using your NetID, an underscore '_', the word
'assignment' and the assignment number, all in lower case. For example, if your 
NetID is `aaa11` then the repository for this assignment would be `aaa11_assignment3`.
Clone this repository to your local computer. Commit any files that you are required
to create as part of the assignment, then push the changes back to GitHub. Whatever is
in the repository at the due date will be graded.*
